# 2 - Why "Grid v2.x.x"?

I am proud of Grid-v1's size: the `gr` flavor was just 1.630 B! Then, I don't want to mess with this and in order to add some features in the grid system, I created this new branch on git-hub. 

In this release, there is not a default ready-to-use file, instead we have a few `grid` files. These files can be combined, to keep integration easier with other codes, but that is not necessary. In development, these files are kept separeted.

**I love to write free software (it isn't a software, it's just a CSS file, anyways...), you should check out my git-hub page at [git-hub](http://github.com/guiideandrade) or contact me at my [page](http://guiideandrade.com)**

Some of these files is not needed in prodution, but you should checkout at least *code-you-should-use.css* and this *README.md* file.

## 3.1 - ./README.md

This file. It's the best way I found to communicate about the project. It contains some directives, some links, etc.

I tried to keep this file updated, but the comments in code are usually more accurated than README.md.

## 3.2 - ./code-you-shoud-use.css

This file includes some CSS properties. These codes are recommended, you should consider this lines (it's very small).

## 3.3 - ./grid-basic.css

Definition of `.row`, `.col` and `.float`.

## 3.4 - ./grid.css

Compiled version of *grid-basic.css, grid-default-initial.css, grid-default-offset.css and all css files in folder ./recommended/*. Some files were edited and contain only grids 1-8.

## 3.5 - ./grid-default-basic.css

This file contains 12 grids (1-12) for all viewports.

## 3.6 - ./grid-default-initial.css

This file implements default sizes. For example:

```html
<div class="gr4">...</div>
```

All `.col` elements inside this div will be 25% by default.

## 3.7 - ./grid-default-offset.css

Offsets, or 'empty cols'; You may edit it to be margin-right, if rtl is needed.

## 3.8 - ./grid.min.css

Minified version of grid.css (see 3.4).

## 3.9 - ./main.cpp

I used this c++ file to create base css files. I choose to leave it in the project, because it may be useful for me and others.

## 3.10 - ./breakpoints folder

This folder contains files modified to use specific breakpoint. But all viewports have from 1 to 12-column grid.

## 3.11 - ./recommended folder

This folder contains recommended versions of this project, modified to use breakpoint. Grid availability for device:

  * small devices: 1-2
  * medium devices: 1-4
  * large devices: 1-6
  * extra large devices: 1-8
