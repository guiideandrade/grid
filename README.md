# 2 - Why "Grid v2.x.x"?

I am proud of Grid-v1's size: the `gr` flavor was just 1.630 B! Then, I don't want to mess with this and in order to add some features in the grid system, I created this new branch on git-hub. 

In this release, there is not a default ready-to-use file, instead we have a few `grid` files. These files can be combined, to keep integration easier with other codes, but that is not necessary. In development, these files are kept separeted.

**I love to write free software (it isn't a software, it's just a CSS file, anyways...), you should check out my git-hub page at [git-hub](http://github.com/guiideandrade) or contact me at my [page](http://guiideandrade.com)**

These files is not needed in prodution, but you should checkout at least *code-you-should-use.css* and this *README.md* file.

## 3.1 - code-you-shoud-use.css

This file includes some CSS properties. These codes are recommended, you should consider this lines (it's very small).

## 3.2 - README.md

This file. It's the best way I found to communicate about the project. It contains some directives, some links, etc. If you are looking for explanations about the code, notice that I wrote some comments while writing the source-code.

I tried to keep this file updated, but the comments in code are usually more accurated than README.md.
