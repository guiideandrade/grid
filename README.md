# Why "Grid v2"?

I am proud of Grid-v1's size: the `gr` flavor was just 1.630 B! Then, I don't want to mess with this and in order to add some features in the grid system, I created this new branch on git-hub.

**I love to write free software (it isn't a software, it's just a CSS file, anyways...), you should check out my git-hub page at [git-hub](http://github.com/guiideandrade) or contact me at my [page](http://guiideandrade.com)**
