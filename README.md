# 2 - Why "Grid v2.x.x"?

The project had 3 subversions inside Grid v1.x, each one used different features (better class names, better grid groups and better minimisation). The *gr* flavor was just 1.630 B in size!

In order to preserve these features and still add some new features, a new branch called [devel](https://github.com/guiideandrade/grid/tree/devel) was created in the same git repo. This new branch contains the development files for next release.

At grid 2.x, a default or ready-to-use file is not present, instead a few files were generated usign the C++ file. These files should be combined or compressed before being put in prodution sites.

Grid [v2.1.0-beta](http://github.com/guiideandrade/grid/releases) was pre-released on git-hub. The development version now is Grid v2.2.x. See differences betweed v2.1 and v2.2 inside docs.
